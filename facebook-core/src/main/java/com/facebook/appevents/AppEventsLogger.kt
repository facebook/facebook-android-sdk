/**
 * The AppEventsLogger class allows the developer to log various types of events back to Facebook.
 * In order to log events, the app must create an instance of this class via a [
 * newLogger][.newLogger] method, and then call the various "log" methods off of that.
 *
 * This client-side event logging is then available through Facebook App Insights and for use with
 * Facebook Ads conversion tracking and optimization.
 *
 * The AppEventsLogger class has a few related roles:
 *
 * * Logging predefined and application-defined events to Facebook App Insights with a numeric value
 * to sum across a large number of events, and an optional set of key/value parameters that define
 * "segments" for this event (e.g., 'purchaserStatus' : 'frequent', or 'gamerLevel' :
 * 'intermediate'). These events may also be used for ads conversion tracking, optimization, and
 * other ads related targeting in the future.
 * * Methods that control the way in which events are flushed out to the Facebook servers.
 *
 * Here are some important characteristics of the logging mechanism provided by AppEventsLogger:
 *
 * * Events are not sent immediately when logged. They're cached and flushed out to the Facebook
 * servers in a number of situations:
 *
 * * when an event count threshold is passed (currently 100 logged events).
 * * when a time threshold is passed (currently 15 seconds).
 * * when an app has gone to background and is then brought back to the foreground.
 *
 * * Events will be accumulated when the app is in a disconnected state, and sent when the
 * connection is restored and one of the above 'flush' conditions are met.
 * * The AppEventsLogger class is intended to be used from the thread it was created on. Multiple
 * AppEventsLoggers may be created on other threads if desired.
 * * The developer can call the setFlushBehavior method to force the flushing of events to only
 * occur on an explicit call to the `flush` method.
 * * The developer can turn on console debug output for event logging and flushing to the server by
 * calling FacebookSdk.addLoggingBehavior(LoggingBehavior.APP_EVENTS);
 *
 * Some things to note when logging events:
 *
 * * There is a limit on the number of unique event names an app can use, on the order of 1000.
 * * There is a limit to the number of unique parameter names in the provided parameters that can be
 * used per event, on the order of 25. This is not just for an individual call, but for all
 * invocations for that eventName.
 * * Event names and parameter names must be between 2 and 40 characters, and must consist of
 * alphanumeric characters, _, -, or spaces.
 * * The length of each parameter value can be no more than on the order of 100 characters.
