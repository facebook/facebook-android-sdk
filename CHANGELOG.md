# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [14.0.0]
### Removed
- Removed deprecated `ShareOpenGraphAction`, `ShareOpenGraphContent`, `ShareOpenGraphValueContainer` and `ShareOpenGraphObject` classes.

## [13.2.0]
### Added
- Added `LoginManager.createLogInActivityResultContract()` and `FacebookDialog.createActivityResultContractForShowingDialog()` methods to expose the activity result contracts.
- Support for CloudBridge for AppEvents. This feature is available for selected partners now.

### Fixed
- The client token is now mandatory. SDK initialization will have a check on it and throw out an exception if the client token is not available.

## [13.1.0]
### Added
- All classes from the deprecated [Bolts](https://github.com/BoltsFramework/Bolts-Android) library are moved to an independent `facebook-bolts` kit. Now all kits depend on it to keep the back-compatibility, but we will gradually remove the dependency.
### Fixed
- `AppEventsLogger.setUserID()` allows to receive null value to clear the user ID.
- Fixed the crashes if WebView is not available.

### Deprecated
- Deprecate `ShareOpenGraphAction`, `ShareOpenGraphContent`, `ShareOpenGraphValueContainer` and `ShareOpenGraphObject` since Open Graph stories will only render as plan link shares. See [Open Graph Stories document](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph) for more details.

## [13.0.0]

### Added
- Set Java source and target compatibility to 1.8 (Java 8). All apps that integrate with Facebook Android SDK should also set source and compatibility to 1.8 or above.
- GMS AD_ID Permission is added to the SDK by default for requesting the advertising ID. You can follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248) to remove the permission request.

### Removed
- Removed the support for tokenless requests. Now all Graph API requests must be associated with an access token and the app needs to have a client token to construct the access token without a logged in user. Please follow [this document](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/#add-app_id) to add the client token into `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- Removed deprecated LikeView and various related classes (LikeButton, LikeContent, LikeDialog etc)
- Removed deprecated Device Sharing classes (DeviceShareButton, DeviceShareDialog, DeviceShareDialogFragment)
- Removed deprecated Messenger Sharing classes (ShareMessengerMediaTemplateContent, ShareMessengerGenericTemplateContent etc)
- Removed deprecated Fblite Login

### Fixed
- Fixed the bug of handling sharing result if the post id is not available.

## [12.3.0]

### Added
- Avoid tokenless requests if the client token is presented. Tokenless request support will be removed in v13.0.

### Deprecated

### Fixed
- Fixed reauthorization of data access.

### Fixed
- On Android 12 and above, AppEvents will send attribution ID and anonymous ID if GMS is supported and isTrackingLimited is OFF. On Android 11 and below, nothing is changed. This feature will be turned on after Google Play Store starts the enforcement of the new policy.
