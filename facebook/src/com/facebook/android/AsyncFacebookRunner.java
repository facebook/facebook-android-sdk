/**
 * A sample implementation of asynchronous API requests. This class provides
 * the ability to execute API methods and have the call return immediately,
 * without blocking the calling thread. This is necessary when accessing the
 * API in the UI thread, for instance. The request response is returned to 
 * the caller via a callback interface, which the developer must implement.
 *
 * This sample implementation simply spawns a new thread for each request,
 * and makes the API call immediately.  This may work in many applications,
 * but more sophisticated users may re-implement this behavior using a thread
 * pool, a network thread, a request queue, or other mechanism.  Advanced
 * functionality could be built, such as rate-limiting of requests, as per
 * a specific application's needs.
 *
 * @see RequestListener
 *        The callback interface.
