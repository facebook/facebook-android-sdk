    |                                                              |
    | Facebook-Core : 52.46 kb                                     |
    |                                                              |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------+
    
Example: Including the Facebook-Login module (which depends on Facebook-Common and Facebook-Core) would
increase your app's size by an estimated 243.91 kb and including just Facebook-Core would only increase
your size by 50.98 kb.

USAGE
-----
Facebook SDKs are broken up into separate modules as shown above. To ensure the most optimized use of
space only install the modules that you intend to use. To get started, see the Installation section below.

INSTALLATION
------------
Facebook SDKs are published to Maven as independent modules. To utilize a feature listed above
include the appropriate dependency (or dependencies) listed below in your `app/build.gradle` file. 
    
    dependencies {
        // Facebook Core only (Analytics)
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-core:4.27.0'
        
        // Facebook Login only
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-login:4.27.0'
        
        // Facebook Share only
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-share:4.27.0'
        
        // Facebook Places only
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-places:4.27.0'
        
        // Facbeook Messenger only
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-messenger:4.27.0'

        // Facebook Android SDK (everything)
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.27.0'
    }

You may also need to add the following to your project/build.gradle file.

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral() 
        }
    }
