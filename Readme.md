USAGE
Facebook SDKs are broken up into separate modules as shown above. To ensure the most optimized use of space only install the modules that you intend to use. To get started, see the Installation section below.

Any Facebook SDK initialization must occur only in the main process of the app. Use of Facebook SDK in processes other than the main process is not supported and will likely cause problems.

INSTALLATION
Facebook SDKs are published to Maven as independent modules. To utilize a feature listed above include the appropriate dependency (or dependencies) listed below in your app/build.gradle file.

dependencies {
    // Facebook Core only (Analytics)
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-core:latest.release'

    // Facebook Login only
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-login:latest.release'

    // Facebook Share only
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-share:latest.release'

    // Facebook Messenger only
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-messenger:latest.release'

    // Facebook App Links only
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-applinks:latest.release'

    // Facebook Android SDK (everything)
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:latest.release'
}
You may also need to add the following to your project/build.gradle file.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
