  Bluetooth), retrieve a list of place candidates along with confidence level estimatesâ€”that your user is at those \
  places. By providing a place ID, retrieve place-related information about the place (for example, address and hours \
  of operation). If your request is authenticated with a user access token, then you can also retrieve social-related \
  information like the number of friends who liked and checked into the place.</html>

  a social login.</html>
